This program was made for my 12th grade gifted class
All the progrma does is takes in a string, does some regular expressions to it, then spits out an answer
The name is DanielleProgram because that was one of my classmates in that class

A very fun easy project. I atribute my proficiency in understanding RegEx's to this project.
